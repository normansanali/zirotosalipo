This shows that there was a moment, however brief, that he thought he could get away with it. I don’t believe in the brain damage theory. He killed 2 people and believed he could go wrestle. The concussion theory doesn’t really stick with me.”</p><p>Sandra brought new, haunting information to light in this interview.&nbsp;</p><p>“Yes, my brother-in-law had concussions, he hit his head for a living and I understand that. But way beyond that, he had a very serious drug and steroid problem. Unfortunately, a lot of athletes still do to this day. It’s spiraling out of control. His heart was huge, about 3 times normal size, and it was ready to blow up at any moment.”</p><p>She also spoke on the effects that Eddie Guerrero and other wrestler’s deaths had on the Benoit family.&nbsp;</p><p>“…Chris had suffered multiple losses of friends. Eddie Guerrero’s death in 2005 shocked us all, no one was prepared for that. It was devastating for Nancy but it was devastating for Chris on a whole other level. Eddie’s passing came after a long line of huge losses and Chris was in a state of perpetual bereavement …&nbsp;The final blow came in mid-June 2007, just a few days before everything happened, when Sherri Martel passed away. That devastated Nancy just as much as Eddie’s death had devastated Chris.”&nbsp;</p><p>In an interesting note, it appears as though Chris Benoit may have actually been planning on stepping away from the WWE shortly before his death.&nbsp;</p><p>“After Eddie passed away, Chris and Nancy discussed the possibility of Chris leaving the WWE and starting his own wrestling school. As a matter of fact, it had become more than a possibility. A business plan had been developed and merchandise had been designed. However, the WWE was prepared to give Chris a big push and put him into another championship match so Chris began training harder and pushing his body further. Chris did a lot of self-medicating.”</p><p>Please take some time and check out this lengthy, unique look into Chris Benoit’s life, and the drama surrounding him and his family.

In it, Sandra talks about a range of topics including issues with Chris and Nancy’s marriage, their relationship with Paul Heyman and a lot more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfpZtbHFtXaeysbvRrWScoKKewG6uxKemoqw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sam-burns-girlfriend-or-wife-caroline-campbell-career-and-net-worth-explored.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sam Burns Girlfriend Or Wife: Caroline Campbell Career And Net Worth Explored">&larr;
