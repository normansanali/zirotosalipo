She wrote: "I’m so excited to share this news with you. Four years ago, I decided I wanted to have a child. I wanted to do it on my own terms. I now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way.</p><p id=eMmoGx8gJJqQ data-wc=77>"I hope we arrive at a point in which it’s normalized to not want a ring in order to have a crib. A part of me wants to uphold that my private life is none of anyone’s business. I also get that the nature of my job compels me to take control of this. My daughter was born on April 8, 2021. Her name is Oonagh Paige Heard. She’s the beginning of the rest of my life."</p><p id=ewk9TQqynVYA data-wc=9><strong>Amber introduced her daughter to the world via Instagram</strong></p><p id=eGRXICRhFjnD data-wc=48>The actress also revealed online that she is the "mom and the dad" to her daughter after she was welcomed into the world via a surrogate.

She added: "I feel truly lucky to have been her daughter and been given the gift of having the light she shone on everyone, fall on me for nearly 34 years."</p><h2>Was has Amber Heard said about her Johnny Depp trial verdict?</h2><p id=eH6AkU0uwwK data-wc=53>The former couple met on the set of&nbsp;The Rum Diary in 2009, and started dating in 2012. They got engaged in 2014 and married in 2015. The Magic Mike 2 star filed for divorce in 2016 after 15 months of marriage, and they reached a $7 million divorce settlement in August 2016.</p><p id=eJ7KW8yWUYI data-wc=32>The star has kept a low profile since their summer 2022 trial, which concluded when a seven-person jury found that she defamed Johnny in her 2018 Washington Post op-ed about domestic violence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e2b64369e2e7-johnny-depp.jpg><p id=eKR0nlOgS2P data-wc=31>The last fans heard from Amber was from an Instagram post on December 19, 2022, when she announced the "difficult decision" to settle the defamation case brought against her by ex-husband.</p><p id=er7HPueGmdc data-wc=55>"It's important for me to say that I never chose this," she wrote at the time, adding: "I defended my truth and in doing so my life as I knew it was destroyed. The vilification I have faced on social media is an amplified version of the ways women are re-victimised when they come forward.</p><p id=eNnPlETAfgL data-wc=78>"Now I finally have an opportunity to emancipate myself from something I attempted to leave over six years ago and on terms I can agree to," she further said, explaining: "I have made no admission. This is not an act of concession. There are no restrictions or gags with respect to my voice moving forward. I make this decision having lost faith in the American legal system, where my unprotected testimony served as entertainment and social media fodder."</p><p id=e-PnUw9a4A data-wc=10><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Johnny Depp discusses family 'pain' amid Amber Heard divorce</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ewT4mT9I0R data-wc=48>She further said: "I exhausted almost all my resources in advance of and during a trial in which I was subjected to a courtroom in which abundant, direct evidence that corroborated my testimony was excluded and in which popularity and power mattered more than reason and due process."</p><p id=eC-k3QpBW6N data-wc=56>Amber concluded her statement by thanking her judicial team for the growing support from not only fans, but fellow survivors of domestic abuse. "I cannot find enough words to tell you the hope your belief in me inspires, not just for me, but for all of you," she wrote, ending with: "Thank you.
