It falls to Eivor to find the traitor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Who-Betrayed-Soma-AC-Valhalla.jpg><p>In <a href=#><strong>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</strong></a>, Soma, the leader of Grantebridgescire, has been betrayed by one of her inner circle. One of them allowed the enemy to sneak into Grantebridge and attack without warning. Soma and her people were driven into the nearby swamps. Were it not for the timely intervention of Eivor, Grantebridge and Grantebridgescire as a whole would remain under Saxon control (and under the thumb of the Order of the Ancients). But who actually betrayed Soma in AC Valhalla?</p><p><strong>[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Assassin's Creed: Valhalla.]</strong></p><p>Someone from Soma's inner circle - Birna, Lif, or Galinn - showed the invading army the secret passage underneath the Longhouse that allowed them to strike at the heart of the village. It falls to Eivor to deduce <a href=#>who the traitor is in AC Valhalla</a>, but this proves more difficult than it initially seems. Each of them has a reason to want to betray her, and there is evidence that points toward each of them. In the end, gathering all the clues mounts much more evidence against one of them.</p><p>To figure out the traitor in the "Stench of Treachery" quest, players will need to look to Galinn. He is the only one who wasn't accounted for before or during the attack, and most of the possible evidence gathered points toward him. Confirming it will involve questioning witnesses, talking to the suspects, and hunting around the village and nearby swamps for clues about who betrayed Soma in <a href=#>Assassin's Creed Valhalla's&nbsp;story</a>.</p><h2 id=how-to-find-out-who-betrayed-soma-in-ac-valhalla>How To Find Out Who Betrayed Soma In AC Valhalla</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-Soma-Stench-Treachery-Traitor.jpg><p>Questioning the townsfolk reveals that two of the lieutenants were witnessed in the village either before or during the attack. Birna was seen drinking in the Longhouse, and Lif was seen fighting after the Saxons attacked. Questioning both Lif and Birna will have them confirm these stories. If <a href=#>Eivor in Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> has a high enough charisma, Galinn will&nbsp;claim that he was meditating far from the village at the time of the attack. Another witness claims to have seen someone running away from the village before the attack, and another still claims that one of the longships wasn't where it usually was.</p><p>To uncover physical proof, Eivor must recreate the traitor's path from the night of the attack. Starting at the secret tunnel beneath the Longhouse, Eivor finds an "X" marking on a wall near the outer entrance, as well as a trail of paint spatters leading away. Eivor deduces that the traitor painted the X as a marking to mark the entrance. Following the trail of paint spatters, Eivor uncovers a bucket of yellow paint hidden in a tree stump. Following the river north of the village (but not too far unless players want to try and&nbsp;<a href=#>defeat Goneril&nbsp;in Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>), Eivor will come across a longship painted yellow. The poem carved into it references Galinn. Following a trail of bodies leads to the area where Eivor rescued Galinn previously. In the hamlet near the longship, a note from Wigmund can be found saying that the yellow longship is not to be harmed.</p><p>Once the evidence is collected, Eivor can go to Soma and accuse one of the inner circle. Soma will then gather the three and execute the one that was accused. She will thank Eivor before making her way to the Isle of Ely to find Wigmund. If someone other than Galinn is accused of betraying Soma, Soma still executes them. This&nbsp;affects the following mission, as Galinn will hold the other remaining member of the inner circle hostage. The encounter ends with both Galinn and the other member dead.&nbsp;This shows that choices matter in <strong>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</strong>, as&nbsp;betrayal could have lethal consequences.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>AC Valhalla Problems The Next Assassin's Creed Must Avoid</a></span></p>Related Topics About The Author<p>Cody Prater is a freelance writer, gamer, and dungeon master currently operating out of Roanoke, Virginia.
