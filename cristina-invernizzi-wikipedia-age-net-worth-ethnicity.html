Yes, though the revelation came late, it was reported that the two held a small ceremony in February 2021.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this Cristina Invernizzi Wikipedia to learn more.</span></p><h3><b>Jordan Belfort And Cristina Invernizzi’s Relationship</b></h3><p><span>Cristina Invernizzi first met the so-called “Wolf of Wall Street”, Jordan Belfort back in 2019. After dating a while, the pair moved in together at their apartment in Los Angeles, and two years later, they headed to Miami.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The last we saw them was at a Les Couleurs Charity event at </span><i><span>Le Rouge</span></i><span> in Wynwood — where Jordan surprised the audience by introducing his new wife Cristina.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Reportedly, the wedding was held in Las Vegas, alongside a few friends and family.</span></p><p><span>Before the </span><i><span>Le Rouge</span></i><span> event, the couple was spotted at the Miami outpost of power dining spot </span><i><span>Carbone</span></i><span> bonding with Drake. Yes, the rapper.</span></p><p><span>The pair celebrated their anniversary every December 11.</span></p><p><span>If you don’t know, Jordan has been married twice before.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He first married Denise Lombardo, an </span><i><span>Adelphi University</span></i><span> graduate at an intimate wedding ceremony in 1985. At the time, he was financially struggling and after his success with </span><i><span>Stratton Oakmont</span></i><span>, he chose a lifestyle of drugs, affairs, and extravagant parties. This was what led the two to separate in 1991.</span></p><p><span>Then came, Nadine Caridi (currently known as Nadine Macaluso), whom Jordan met at the end of the 80s, while still married to his first wife. The pair got married the same year Jordan divorced Denise.
