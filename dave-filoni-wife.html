Just recently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave's promotion</a> to executive creative director at Lucasfilm became news because the company updated its website. In the wake of this news, many fans want to know more about Dave's personal life.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Dave Filoni's wife?</h2><p>Although <a href=#>Star Wars fans</a> know plenty about Dave's work life, they know less about the people he goes home to. Dave's wife E. Anne Covery is also connected to the world of Star Wars, and not just through Dave. Anne <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote the short story</a> "Bug", which appeared in the anthology The Clone Wars: Stories of Light and Dark. The book was based on an episode of The Clone Wars, which her husband worked on.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Dave also named a species of owl in the Star Wars universe after his wife. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Convorees</a> are creatures that can be found throughout the galaxy, and they resemble normal owls in most ways with the exception of their tails.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the birds don't play a major role in the show's plot, they're a lovely expansion of canon that obviously has a personal connection for Dave.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Dave Filoni have any kids?</h2><p>It's currently unclear whether Dave has kids. If he does, he doesn't post about them frequently on social media or bring them up in interviews. Although he's a powerful force behind one of the biggest franchises in the world, Dave is clearly not a public figure in the way that the stars of <a href=#>The Mandalorian</a> might be. Even if he does have kids, he's likely working hard to shield them from press exposure.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Dave Filoni's net worth?</h2><p>Although he's one of the most powerful figures in the world of Star Wars, Dave has a relatively modest overall net worth. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, his total net worth is around $4 million. Dave is still on the rise in the world of Star Wars, though, so it's possible that his net worth will continue to increase as he takes on more and more responsibility inside of Lucasfilm.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thank you for all the Birthday wishes. As always, here is a drawing for all of you.

His work on the animated Clone Wars and on The Mandalorian has convinced fans that he has a deep knowledge of and appreciation for all things Star Wars, which is why many see the news about his still fairly new role as a step in the right direction for the franchise.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma63sYyfoKWnnp56uLXFng%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./griffin-gluck-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Griffin Gluck Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)">&larr;
