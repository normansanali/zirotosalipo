She quickly grew very successful and popular. Today she has 16 million followers on TikTok. Her fame has certainly given her many amazing opportunities within establishing her career. This year she attended the Met Gala as an interviewer on the red carpet. This event although a big milestone for Chamberlain surprisingly causes a lot of backlash over what she was wearing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-chamberlain-39-s-journey-to-fame>Emma Chamberlain's Journey To Fame</h2><p>When Emma Chamberlain rose to fame from her YouTube channel, she won the 2018 Streamy Award for Breakout Creator. This is a huge deal within the YouTube content creator community. The reason she became so popular was that fans saw her as very different in her vlogging style than any other creators at the moment. <a href=#>She was open, honest, funny, and extremely relatable.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Does Emma Chamberlainâ€™s Daily Vegetarian Diet Look Like?</a></span></p><p>She has been featured in Time Magazine on its The 25 Most Influential People On The Internet list, became an ambassador for Louis Vuitton, and even attended New York Fashion Week. All of these accomplishments were within a year of her sudden popularity on YouTube.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has won multiple awards including a Teen Choice Award and a People's Choice Award. In 2019, she created and launched her very own podcast called Anything Goes, it was previously named Stupid Genius but changed. Another incredible accomplishment of Chamberlain's was being included in Forbes' Social Media Category in their '30 Under 30' list.</p><p>She also owns her own coffee company which relates back to her YouTube channel because she was often known to show how she made her iced coffee in her vlogs and fans loved to see it.</p><h2 id=the-controversy-over-emma-39-s-met-gala-outfit-and-her-reaction>The Controversy Over Emma's Met Gala Outfit And Her Reaction</h2><p>Fast-forward to the 2022 Met Gala that happened just this month. Chamberlain attended as an interviewer on the red carpet. The theme for this year was 'Gilded Glamour'. <a href=#>She is known for her unique style</a> that she shares on her Instagram feed, so fans were definitely excited to see her look for the glamorous event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What Chamberlain probably didn't know was that a part of her outfit would <a href=#>spark a huge debate across the Internet.</a> She wore a two-piece Louis Vuitton outfit and a full tiara that complimented her bleach blonde bob. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chamberlain was signed to Cartier as an ambassador</a>, so it made sense to see her sporting a beautiful necklace designed by the brand on the carpet.</p><p>The huge problem with the outfit was that exact Cartier-designed necklace. The necklace has a historical past as it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">notably a possession of Indian royalty, Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala.</a> This necklace suddenly went missing around 1948 and is believed to have been stolen by the British because it showed up in a London jewelry store in the '90s. Which is where it was bought by Cartier.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Did Kim Kardashian's Marilyn Monroe Look From The Met Gala Receive Such Mixed Reaction</a></span></p><p>Fans and nonfans were extremely upset over this. Whether Chamberlain knew or not didn't mean anything to them because they argued that she should have done her own research regarding something she was wearing. Many people saw this as blatant disrespect and cultural insensitivity. Chamberlain has yet to comment about the controversies and hasn't acknowledged them at all.</p><h2 id=emma-chamberlain-39-s-current-success>Emma Chamberlain's Current Success</h2><p>It is pretty safe to say that although people are extremely upset with Chamberlain not only wearing the necklace but not addressing the issues fans brought up to her. It is disappointing to them. It is highly unlikely that Chamberlain has not seen the discourse going on about it on Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and quite frankly the entire internet.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Secret Behind Nia Sioux's YouTube Success</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cartier has not responded either. Since the Met Gala happened at the beginning of this month and Chamberlain has posted on her Instagram since then, it seems that she will not be addressing it anytime soon or possibly ever. Chamberlain is still on Instagram and has been posting about more business ventures she has going on.</p><p>She recently posted that she has a collaboration with the famous brand Levi's. Chamberlain has also been posting selfies and that she was celebrating her 21st birthday, which was on May 22nd. Although receiving controversy, Chamberlain is still going on with her career and being a young successful creator. Chamberlain may possibly in the future address the concerns fans had regarding her Met Gala outfit, but it is unclear if or when that will happen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Fans Think BeyoncÃ© Skipped The Met Gala Because She 'Didn't Need' To Be There</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmnZqmo2Kus7GMrKZmraCosrV5wJumrqxdmrqurYycn5qlkpq%2Fra3Ip6pmpZWpeqity5pkqK2km7a1ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./us-coast-guard-working-find-divers-missing-off-north-carolina-coast.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Four divers found alive off North Carolina coast, Coast Guard reports  WSOC TV">&larr;
