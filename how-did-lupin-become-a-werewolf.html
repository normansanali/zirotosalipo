Remus <b>was turned by Fenrir Greyback</b>, who sought revenge on his father for his unkind words about the werewolf community. The attack took place just before his fifth birthday, and although Lyall burst in and saved his son from death, the attack left Remus as a werewolf himself.</strong></p><p>Thereof Is Sirius Black a werewolf? Yet, after Remus transforms following the events in the Shrieking Shack that led to Peter Pettigrew’s identification, Remus’s admission that <b>he was a werewolf</b>, and Sirius Black’s status as a dog Animagus, while on the way back to the castle, Remus transforms into a werewolf and he and Sirius (in Animagus form) get into …</p><p>What is Ron’s Patronus? Ron’s Patronus is <b>a Jack Russell Terrier</b>. Here’s why we think this particular four-legged friend makes perfect sense for the youngest Weasley brother.</p><p>Subsequently, Was Bill Weasley a werewolf? <b>Bill did not become a werewolf</b> but did develop a liking for very rare steaks. It was his injuries that finally convinced his mother that Fleur was the right choice for him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_the_age_difference_between_Lupin_and_Tonks></span>What is the age difference between Lupin and Tonks?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At the end of the book, it is revealed that Nymphadora Tonks has fallen in love with Remus (<b>Remus is 13 years older than Tonks</b>). He resisted becoming involved with her because of the risks from his being a werewolf, and he said he is, “too old, too poor, and too dangerous,” for her.</p><p>What’s the difference between Lupin and Sirius? Remus is a werewolf (Mooney), Peter is a rat (Wormtail), Sirius is <b>a dog (Padfoot)</b>, and James was a stag (Prongs).</p><p>Did Sirius get bit by Lupin? Sirius was <b>bitten/scratched by Lupin in werewolf form</b> and he didnt become one of them.</p><p>Is Nymphadora Tonks Hufflepuff? Tonks attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1984 to 1991 and was <b>Sorted into Hufflepuff House</b>. She was in the same year at Hogwarts as Gryffindor Charlie Weasley.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What%E2%80%99s_Hermione%E2%80%99s_Patronus></span>What’s Hermione’s Patronus?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>Otter</b> (Hermione Granger)</p><p>Her Patronus, the otter, is a clever and dexterous animal; some have even been known to juggle small rocks.</p><p>What was Luna Lovegood’s Patronus? In the films, Lynch’s patronus for Lovegood was a hare, but after taking the official quiz, she was assigned <b>a salmon</b>, which wasn’t quite what she had anticipated.</p><p>Was Fleur Delacour a Weasley?</p><p>Fleur Isabelle Weasley (née Delacour) (born c. 1977) was a French, quarter-<b>Veela witch</b> daughter of Monsieur and Apolline Delacour and elder sister of Gabrielle. Fleur began attending the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in 1988. … Fleur fought alongside her husband during the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998.</p><p>Is Lavender Brown a werewolf?</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_old_is_Fleur_Delacour></span>How old is Fleur Delacour?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fleur Delacour is at <b>most 21</b> when she marries Bill Weasley, who is a bit older, at 26.</p><p>How did Tonks get pregnant?</p><p>She formed part of the Advance Guard and bravely participated in the Battle of the Seven Potters. Tonks became <b>pregnant by this</b> time and Remus began to worry that he had passed on his werewolf condition to their son, though this proved not to be the case as the child had inherited only Tonks’ metamorphic abilities.</p><p>Why did Remus regret marrying Tonks? Remus was extremely upset by the pregnancy. He believed that by <b>marrying Tonks he had made her an outcast among society</b>, because of his lycanthropy, as well as feared that he would pass on his affliction to their child.</p><p>Who was Sirius Black in love with? Sirius Black had a lot of love in his life. Mainly for his best friends but still. One of the greatest loves came not from his connection to James Potter but rather with his relationship to <b>Remus Lupin</b>. The two had an interesting dynamic and one that fans seemed to gravitate towards.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Sirius_and_Remus_a_couple></span>Was Sirius and Remus a couple?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The exact word is <b>bros not couples</b>. But perceived as couples to many points due to nature of their relationships. Lupin, and the dearly departed Sirius Black, were both complicated father figures for Harry, but that’s not why many Potter fans embraced them so fiercely.</p><p>Are Sirius and Remus in love? It turns out (naturally) that <b>Sirius was framed</b>, and even after their twelve-year separation he and Lupin remain fiercely devoted to each other. By book 5, the two of them are living together in secret.</p><p>Are Lupin and Snape friends?</p><p>Remus knew that <b>he and Snape would never be friends</b>, however he respected the fact that Snape brewed the (very tricky) potion which enabled him to hold down a job for a year and got it right every time. It shows that it’s possible to work with somebody without necessarily liking them or being friends with them.</p><p>Did Sirius and Remus date? <b>No, never, not at all</b>. Sirius and Remus were good childhood friends, but it was clear that both boys were closer to James than to the other, with Sirius being James’s best friend. Even as adults, while they are each other’s closest friends, they don’t spend as much time together and many fans think they do.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_Muggles_become_werewolves></span>Can Muggles become werewolves?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He also learned from the werewolves that Muggles “taste” different to wizards and that they are much more likely to die of their wounds, whereas witches and wizards survive to become werewolves. Neat, so <b>they can become werewolves</b>, but are more likely to be devoured as opposed to just bitten.</p><p>How did Sirius Black become a dog? The Potters took Sirius in as their own son. … Sirius was <b>an animagus</b> and was able to transform into a big black dog, (a Grim) which is an omen of death, at will. He, along with James Potter and Peter Pettigrew became Animagus to help Remus Lupin with his transformations.</p><h2></h2><p>Don’t forget to share this post 🖤</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1ktbDDjJ2gnWWcqr2quoybnJynnZp6onnWnqmer5%2Bhs3A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./inside-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce18k-a-night-lavish-bahamas-love-nest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Inside Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's $18k-a-night lavish Bahamas love nest">&larr;
