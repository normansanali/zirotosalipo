For the first three years of his contract, Ohtani will earn the league minimum, which is set at $570,500 for the 2021 season.

These endorsement deals not only provide financial rewards but also help solidify Ohtani's status as a global sports icon.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Off-Field Ventures</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In addition to his baseball earnings and endorsement deals, Shohei Ohtani has also ventured into various off-field business opportunities. Ohtani has invested in real estate and other ventures, demonstrating his financial acumen and ability to diversify his income streams. While the specifics of these off-field ventures are not widely known, they serve as a testament to Ohtani's entrepreneurial spirit and his desire to secure his financial future beyond his playing career.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Shohei Ohtani's financial success is a result of his exceptional talent, hard work, and marketability.
