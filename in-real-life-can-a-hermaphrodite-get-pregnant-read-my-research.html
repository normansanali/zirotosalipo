Myra</p><p>hmmm very interesting information however I’m still confused since it says female, does that means the female hermaphrodite have the physical appearance of a woman. Vincent has the physcial appearance of a man, but disguised himself as a woman so I’m guessing he is or should be male hermaphodite if this is true then it would have been better if Val was real and Vincent was fake.</p><p>Quote <strong>Ms.HuNNii</strong>: hmmm very interesting information however I'm still confused since it says female, does that means the female hermaphrodite looks like a woman. Vincent is a man, looks like a man and disguised himself as a woman so I'm guessing he is or should be male hermaphodite if this is true then it would have been better if Val was real and Vincent was fake.</p><p>Hi Ms. HuNNii. It would mean that Vincent’s genitals are more complete female than male. The person can still dress in either male or female clothes, just like he has done. He couldn’t get a female pregnant, because the male reproductive parts to reproduce aren’t complete. I hope this helps.</p><p>thank you! i get what you mean but in many cases female hermaphrodite appear to be women they have menstral cycles, breast and all where as male hermaphrodite appear to be men, masculine like Vincent is. See what I’m trying to say to pull this off imo Vincent should have been Val it would have at least been believable since the female hermaphrodite is the one that can have the kid.</p><p>Maybe JER didn’t do his homework when he thought up this s/l.</p><p>Quote <strong>AlaNurse</strong>: Maybe JER didn't do his homework when he thought up this s/l.</p><p>This was a very interesting post.

I have always enjoyed doing research especially when it is medical</p><p>well this is passions and a lot of it isnt true anyway so yea</p><p>My partner and I have been trying for a baby for over two years now, We were going to a fertility clinic for about 5 months before somebody told us to contact this spell caster who is so powerful, We contacted him at this email; <a href=#>zogospellcasters@gmail.com</a> , for him to help us, then we told him our problem, he told us that she will either conceive in January 2013 or February 2013,but after two years of trying we were at a point where we were willing to try anything. And I’m glad we came to Dr zogo, Because he predictions put us at ease, and I honestly believe him, and his gods really helped us as well, I am thankful for all he has done.</p><p>I wish to share my testimonies with the general public about what this man called Priest Babaka has just done for me , this man has just brought back my lost Ex husband to me with his great spell, I was married to this man called Wayne we were together for a long time and we loved our self’s but when I was unable to give he a child for 2 years he left me and told me he can’t continue anymore then I was now looking for ways to get him back until a friend of mine told me about this man and gave his contact email ( <a href=#>babaka.wolf@gmail.com</a> ) then you won’t believe this when I contacted this man on my problems he prepared this spell cast and bring my lost husband back, and after a month I miss my month and go for a test and the result stated am pregnant am happy today am a mother of a baby girl, thank you once again the great Priest Babaka for what you have done for me, if you are out there passing through this same kind of problems you can contact he today on his email <a href=#>babaka.wolf@gmail.com</a> or Facebook at priest.babaka and he will also help you as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvIp2SrnZGheq21xZ5knJmeYq5utMSrpJqomKe8pbXTnmSgnaRivbOxxqeYp6xdp7KisIymsGaqlaiyor7CoWZsamFsgnI%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sean-penn-kids-5096173.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet The Actors Two Children Here  Hollywood Life">&larr;
