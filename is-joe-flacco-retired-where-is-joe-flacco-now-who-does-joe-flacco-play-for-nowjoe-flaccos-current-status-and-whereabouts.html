Starting his college football career at Delaware after transferring from Pittsburgh, he captured the attention of the NFL world, particularly the Baltimore Ravens, who selected him in the first round of the 2008 NFL Draft. Flacco’s path in the league has been filled with highs and lows, leading him to different teams and offering diverse experiences.</p><p>Flacco’s time as the starting quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens, spanning from 2008 to the middle of the 2018 season, was marked by numerous achievements.

He later had a stint with the Philadelphia Eagles but eventually returned to the Jets after a starter injury. As of the 2022 NFL season, Flacco holds an impressive record, boasting the most career passing yards and touchdowns for a quarterback who has never been to a Pro Bowl.</p><p>Flacco is not only known for his on-field accomplishments but also for possessing one of the strongest arms in the NFL, leaving fans and opponents in awe throughout his career.</p><p>As Joe Flacco’s journey continues, fans eagerly await the next chapter in this tale of talent, resilience, and a deep passion for a game that has left an enduring mark on American football.</p><table cellspacing=0><tbody><tr><td><p>Name</p></td><td><p>Joe Flacco</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Profession</p></td><td><p>Football Player</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Birthday</p></td><td><p>January 16, 1985</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Birth Sign</p></td><td><p>Capricorn</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Birthplace</p></td><td><p>Audubon, NJ</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Age</p></td><td><p>38 years old</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Joe Flacco’s Retirement Status</h2><p>Although Joe Flacco, the seasoned NFL veteran, has not officially announced his retirement after a remarkable 15-year career, speculation arises about whether he has played his final game.
