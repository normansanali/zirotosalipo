Luffy and his crew of pirates, the Straw Hat Pirates, as they explore the world in search of the ultimate treasure, the One Piece. Along the way, they encounter many friends and foes, including Sabo, the chief of staff of the Revolutionary Army and the sworn brother of Luffy and the late Portgas D. Ace.</p><p>Sabo was first introduced as a child who befriended Luffy and Ace in the Goa Kingdom and shared their dream of becoming pirates. However, he was separated from them after his ship was attacked by a World Noble and he was presumed dead. He later reappeared as an adult during the Dressrosa Arc, where he revealed that he had joined the Revolutionary Army and inherited Ace’s devil fruit, the Mera Mera no Mi, which grants him the power to control fire.</p><p>Sabo’s reunion with Luffy was a heartwarming moment for the fans, who had witnessed the tragic death of Ace during the Marineford War. However, Sabo’s fate was once again put into question after the events of the Reverie, a global summit of the world’s leaders that took place after the Whole Cake Island Arc.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened to Sabo at the Reverie?</h2><p>The Reverie was a major event that had a significant impact on the world of One Piece. During the summit, several important decisions were made, such as the abolition of the Shichibukai system, the declaration of war against the Four Emperors by the Marines, and the revelation of the true history of the world by the Nefertari Family.</p><p>However, the most shocking news that came out of the Reverie was related to Sabo. In Chapter 956, it was shown that the Revolutionary Army had infiltrated the Mary Geoise, the holy land of the World Government, in a mission to rescue Bartholomew Kuma, a former revolutionary who had been turned into a slave and a cyborg by the World Nobles. The mission was led by Sabo, who had a personal connection to Kuma, as he was the one who saved him from his shipwreck 12 years ago.</p><p>The outcome of the mission was unknown, but the news of it caused a huge uproar in the world. Several newspapers reported different versions of the story, some claiming that Sabo had died, some that he had killed a World Noble, and some that he had been captured by the Marines. The news also reached Luffy and his allies, who were shocked and devastated by the possibility of losing another brother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Sabo Really Dead?</h2><p>The answer to this question is still unclear, as the author of the series, Eiichiro Oda, has not confirmed or denied Sabo’s death. However, there are some clues and theories that suggest that Sabo is still alive and that his death was either a false report or a cover-up by the World Government.</p><p>One clue is that Sabo’s bounty poster was not crossed out, unlike Ace’s, which indicates that he is still wanted by the authorities. Another clue is that Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army and Luffy’s father, did not seem to be affected by the news of Sabo’s death, which implies that he knows something that the public does not. A third clue is that Sabo’s hat, which he always wore, was not shown in any of the newspapers, which could mean that he left it behind as a sign of his survival.</p><p>One theory is that Sabo faked his death in order to escape from the World Government and continue his mission. This theory is supported by the fact that Sabo is a master of disguise, as he was able to impersonate Luffy during the Corrida Colosseum tournament in Dressrosa. Another theory is that Sabo was captured by the World Government and is being held prisoner in Impel Down, the most secure prison in the world. This theory is based on the fact that Sabo is a valuable asset for the World Government, as he possesses a powerful devil fruit and has information about the Revolutionary Army and the Straw Hat Pirates.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Future of Sabo</h2><p>Whatever the truth is, Sabo’s fate is likely to be revealed in the future chapters of the series, as his story is not over yet. Sabo is a key character in the plot, as he is connected to many major events and characters, such as the Revolutionary Army, the World Government, the Straw Hat Pirates, and the Four Emperors. Sabo also has a personal goal, which is to fulfill Ace’s will and protect Luffy from any harm.</p><p>Sabo’s fate is also important for the fans, who have grown to love him as a character and as a brother to Luffy and Ace. Sabo’s death would be a devastating blow for the fans, who have already suffered the loss of Ace and many other beloved characters. Sabo’s survival would be a relief and a joy for the fans, who hope to see him reunite with Luffy and his allies and fight alongside them in the final war.</p><p>Is Sabo dead in One Piece? The answer is still unknown, but the hope is still alive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfnsBuv8CbpmaclZaxbrXNZqannV2ltqavxGaroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmZ6gmaOxbsDHnmSfpJGism6xzKmcq6eiqHqltdKap6mdkaeur6%2FEaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kevin-richardsons-wife-kristin-willits-welcomes-son-maxwell-haze-2013127.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kevin Richardson's Wife Kristin Willits Welcomes Son Maxwell Haze">&larr;
