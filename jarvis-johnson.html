He has gained massive popularity for his vlogging about his life as a software engineer alongside challenges and tech commentary. Moreover, between August 23 and 25, 2018, he tamed the YouTube algorithm. It is because he went from 90,000 subscribers to 200,000. This was because a bigger YouTuber named Cody Ko uploaded a video about 5-Minute Crafts.</p><p>In this case, Cody indirectly helped him in gaining more recognition because Johnson uploaded a rant video about the same channel. That video did show up often in the recommendations of Cody’s video since it was a pretty similar video.</p><p>Talking about his video content, he uploads real-life tutorials, creates comedy/entertainment videos, and tech videos about his software engineering career, and rants about channels that he doesn’t like. This includes 5-Minute Crafts, Troom Troom, BRIGHT SIDE, and animated storytime channels like Share My Story and HAPPENED.</p><p>Sometimes, he also uses these “Life Hacks” as a video idea, making videos trying to do said “Hacks”. He even created a channel called “THEY ANIMATED MY STORY” as a satirical parody channel mocking the aforementioned storytime channels by creating exaggerated stories. Additionally, he is also famous for his tech and entertainment vlogging just like another Youtuber Nathan Zed.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-37433 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jarvis-Johnson-Youtube-achievement.jpg alt="Jarvis Johnson" width=650 height=683 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-37433 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Jarvis Johnson received the Youtube golden play button for crossing a million subscribers on his channel in October 2019.
