However, there's one iconic role he found himself unable to consider—all due to love. Read on to learn about the character his late wife Natasha Richardson didn't want him to play and why she threatened to not marry him if he did.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Linda Hamilton Says It Wasn't James Cameron's On-Set Affair That Ended Their Marriage</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/Liam-Neeson-in-1994.jpg><p>Neeson said that James Bond producer <strong>Barbara Broccoli</strong> approached him about playing the famous secret agent in 1995's GoldenEye. At the time, the actor was was fresh off of his Oscar nomination for Best Actor in <strong>Steven Spielberg's</strong> Schindler's List. He was also newly involved with fellow actor Richardson, who he had met while acting in the play Anna Christie on Broadway. Although Richardson was then married to producer <strong>Robert Fox</strong>, sparks flew between the two actors and they soon became a couple.</p><p>"I'd never had that kind of an <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>explosive chemistry situation</a> with an actor, or actress," Liam recalled on 60 Minutes in 2014. "We had just this wonderful kind of dance—free dance on stage every night. She and I were like <strong>[Fred] Astaire</strong> and <strong>[Ginger] Rogers</strong>."</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Pierce Brosnan Can't Watch His James Bond Movies: "It's a Horrible Feeling."</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/Natasha-Richardson-and-Liam-Neeson-in-1994.jpg><p>Neeson and Richardson were filming the <strong>Jodie Foster</strong> drama Nell together in North Carolina when the potential spy role came up. The Love Actually actor later said that his new relationship kept him from even taking a meeting about playing Bond.</p><p>"When I first started getting a couple of calls from Barbara Broccoli about would I be interested, and I said yeah, I would be interested," he said on the podcast Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>as quoted by The Irish Sun</a>. "And Natasha and I weren't married at the time and she said, 'If you are offered James Bond, we're not getting married.'"</p><p>In an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this year, he shared that <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>the character's reputation for womanizing</a> was part of what made Richardson put her foot down.</p><p>"She gave me a James Bond ultimatum," Neeson said. "And she meant it! Come on, there's all those gorgeous girls in various countries getting into bed and getting out of bed. I'm sure a lot of her decision-making was based on that!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/Liam-Neeson-and-Natasha-Richardson-in-2008-2.jpg><p>Although Neeson never formally pursued the role, he admitted to giving his future wife a hard time about the possibility. "I would tease her by going behind her back, making my fingers as though I'm holding a gun, and then [hums the James Bond theme]," he told Rolling Stone. "I loved doing that [expletive]!"<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>However, the actor also admitted he was not a serious contender for Bond, saying on <strong>Conan O'Brien's </strong>podcast, "I wasn't offered James Bond, I think I was on their radar for five minutes."</p><p>He did go on to win a more important role, however, becoming Richardson's husband in July of 1994. Their first son<strong> Micheál</strong> was born the next year, followed by their second son <strong>Daniel</strong> in 1996.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Britt Ekland Says Bond Girls Were "More Fun" Before "Political Correctness."</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/Natasha-Richardson-in-2007.jpg><p>Neeson and Richardson went on to enjoy almost 15 years of marriage together. Tragically, their happiness ended in 2009 when Richardson fell while skiing on Mont Tremblant in Quebec and <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>suffered a traumatic brain injury</a>. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>actor passed away</a> on March 18, 2009 at age 45.</p><p>Neeson told Rolling Stone that he kept his family afloat after Richardson's passing with the help of mother-in-law <strong>Vanessa Redgrave</strong> and sister-in-law <strong>Joely Richardson</strong> and by staying busy in film. "I remember calling my agent and I said, 'I don't care what it is. I'll take anything. I have to work,'" he said.</p><p>While the role of 007 ended up going to <strong>Pierce Brosnan</strong> (and later <strong>Daniel Craig</strong>), the work Neeson threw himself into would eventually give him a second chance at spy movies. In 2008, he originated the role of ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills in the Bourne-inspired action flick Taken, reprising the role in 2012 and 2014 sequels. Asked what Richardson would have thought about his late-career action movie star status, he told 60 Minutes, "She'd be tickled."</p><p><strong>For more celebrity nostalgia sent right to your inbox,&nbsp;<a rel="no-opener noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmpaGRonqvscSspqdlnpbBor%2FHmmSroZOdrrOw0qilZqWfq7amedGoo55n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./matt-damon-george-clooney-twins.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Matt Damon Doesn't Know How George Clooney Will Be Able to Handle Twins">&larr;
