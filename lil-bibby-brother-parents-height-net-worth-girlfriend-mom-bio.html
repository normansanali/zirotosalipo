He grew up on the east side of 79th Street in Chicago.&nbsp;Bibby’s upbringing was far from ideal, he was exposed to street violence at a young age and admits to being hit on several occasions.&nbsp;His mother struggled with substance abuse and drug addiction, which was why he was raised by his older sister at the time.&nbsp;She herself was never a good example, as she was involved in neighborhood gang activity.</span></p><p><span>Growing up, Bibby saw many of his friends taken to prison, most of whom he would never see again.&nbsp;In an interview, Bibby said he grew up on the streets and resented school children.&nbsp;That all changed when he read his all-time favorite book.&nbsp;</span><span>48 Laws of Power</span><span>.&nbsp;He alludes to how the book drastically changed his mindset and helped him see the world in a different light.</span></p><p><span>At age 16, Bibby first met her longtime friend G Herbo at a youth facility, the duo developed an interest in rapping and switching between several styles on a cellphone.&nbsp;They decided to turn their hobby into a profession and went to the studio to record some of their rhymes.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Musical career and collaborations</span></strong></h2><p><span>The rapper released his first mixtape,&nbsp;</span><span>Free Crack</span><span>, on November 29th ,&nbsp;</span><span>2013.</span><span>&nbsp;The mixtape was produced by Grade A Productions.&nbsp;It was made available for digital download only;&nbsp;it has since been downloaded over 225,000 times on the DatPiff online distribution platform.&nbsp;The title of the mixtape is inspired by the title of Kanye West, titled&nbsp;</span><span>Crack Music</span></p><p><span>The rising star was starting to attractIn 2001, rapper Drake said he was a big fan of Lil Bibby’s music.&nbsp;He also said that he and Bibby spoke to each other in 2013. Bibby confessed that this endorsement was a huge encouragement, spurring him to work harder for his content..&nbsp;</span><span>The Water</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Full</span><span>&nbsp;Crew tracks&nbsp;were a direct product of this positive vibe.</span></p><p><strong><span>Also Read: Lil Peep Death, Girlfriend, Gay, Height, Mom, Brother, Family</span></strong></p><p><span>In 2014, he collaborated with fellow rapper and Memphis native Juicy J and featured on the remix of&nbsp;</span><span>lead Poussin</span><span>&nbsp;performed by Kid Ink.&nbsp;Bibby’s second mixtape,&nbsp;</span><span>Free Crack 2</span><span>, was released on August 29, 2014 and was hosted by DJ Drama.&nbsp;There were appearances from Lil Herb, Wiz Khalifa, Juicy J, Kevin Gates, Jadakiss and Anthony Hamilton.</span></p><p><span>Black Entertainment Television (BET) gave the mixtape positive reviews, giving it a five-star rating due to its new level of depth and introspection, explaining that the mixtape details the difficult balance between fame and authenticity and its impact on daily life in some urban war zones in America.</span></p><p><span>Bibby’s other album Free Crack 3 has been downloaded over 272,000 times by the end of 2017.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Lil Bibby’s Girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>Until recently, Bibby’s love life didn’t touch the news as much as his music, for a young man exposed to the life of a thug, it would always be interesting to know who his love is and how he will go about it.</span></p><p><span>In early 2016, a video of Lil Bibby and Johanie Taylor in bed leaked online.&nbsp;The video showed the rapper sound asleep in Johanie’s arms.&nbsp;After the frenzy that surrounded the video, the two parties confirmed in an Instagram post that they really are a couple.&nbsp;Johanie is a model and social media celebrity.</span></p><p><strong><span>Also Read: XXXTentacion Height, Girlfriend, Mom, Teeth, Net Worth, Bio</span></strong></p><h2><strong><span>Lil Bibby’s Family and&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Little is known about Lil Bibby’s family, but what is certain is that growing up, Bibby’s mother was a drug addict.&nbsp;He grew up watching his mother snort drugs at home and admitted he still had bad memories of his childhood.&nbsp;Her older sister was also a member of a street gang.&nbsp;It’s safe to say the Biby family knew it was the gangs on the streets.</span></p><p><span>In an interview, Bibby said he wouldn’t be called, even if his mother was shot.&nbsp;According to him, it is his business to find the author of the crime and to take revenge as he pleases.</span></p><p><span>Current earnings from digital downloads and performances have boosted Lil Bibby’s net worth to $600,000.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGikmaF6o7XBm7BmmqKkwamx0WanmqqVo8G0eceeoKCgpGK7psCMsKarrJhitKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXquu8xmmaKnXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./michael-bivins-net-worth-know-about-his-family-wife-and-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Bivins Net Worth: Know About His Family, Wife and Children">&larr;
