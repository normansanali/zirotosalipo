They kickstarted a revolution in women's wrestling during their early days in developmental, where they put on stellar matches and were dubbed the Four Horsewomen of NXT.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Best Sasha Banks Matches (& The 5 Worst)</a></span></p><p>All four competitors are now multi-time Women's Champions, with Bayley and Becky Lynch currently reigning atop the women's division for SmackDown and Raw. They have wrestled in some of the highest-rated matches in WWE and there is a near-guaranteed place in the Hall of Fame waiting for them. Here are the three best matches of the NXT Four Horsewomen, ranked.</p><h2 id=bayley-women-s-money-in-the-bank-ladder-match-2019><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Bayley: Women's Money In The Bank Ladder Match, 2019</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bayley-Money-in-the-Bank.jpg><p>2019 was a great year for Bayley, who took a leaf out of Becky Lynch's book and rejuvenated her character following a heel turn. Before this, Bayley proved herself by defeating Carmella, Ember Moon, Nikki Cross, Mandy Rose, Natalya, Naomi and Dana Brooke in the women's Money In The Bank ladder match.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The match was fast-paced and told a coherent story, with each Superstar receiving an opportunity to showcase their skills in the spotlight. Bayley cashed in her contract on new champion Charlotte Flair to win her first SmackDown Women's Championship.</p><h2 id=sasha-banks-sasha-banks-vs-ronda-rousey-royal-rumble-2019><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Sasha Banks: Sasha Banks vs. Ronda Rousey, Royal Rumble 2019</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ronda-Rousey-Sasha-Banks-Royal-Rumble.jpg><p>Ronda Rousey has faced each of the NXT Four Horsewomen and one of her most entertaining matches was against Sasha Banks at the Royal Rumble in 2019. The Boss had been mostly overlooked since Becky Lynch's rise to the top of the company, though this match reminded fans that she is one of the best wrestlers in the women's division.</p><p>The in-ring psychology for this match was excellent. Banks brought out the best in Rousey and the two shared a believable mixture of dislike and respect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=becky-lynch-becky-lynch-vs-asuka-royal-rumble-2019><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Becky Lynch: Becky Lynch vs. Asuka, Royal Rumble 2019</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Asuka-Becky-Lynch-Royal-Rumble.jpg><p>The Boss wasn't the only NXT Horsewoman to put on a stellar match at the Royal Rumble. Becky Lynch squared off against Asuka in a losing effort to regain the <a href=#>SmackDown Women's Championship</a>. The two Superstars put on an incredible match with the Empress of Tomorrow retaining her belt, though this didn't stop The Man from later limping to the ring and winning the Royal Rumble match.</p><p>Asuka is one of the most talented wrestlers in the women's division and remains one of Becky Lynch's most formidable enemies. They are set for another Royal Rumble match on January 26th which could see The Man finally beat the Empress after all.</p><h2 id=charlotte-flair-charlotte-flair-vs-trish-stratus-summerslam-2019><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Charlotte Flair: Charlotte Flair vs. Trish Stratus, SummerSlam 2019</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Trish-Stratus-Charlotte-Flair-SummerSlam.jpg><p>Trish Stratus stepped out of retirement and back into the ring for a match against Charlotte Flair at SummerSlam and showed the wrestling world that she's still got it. Trish and Charlotte worked well together and brought the best out of each other as competitors, and hopefully, the two former champions will clash again in the future.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Best Charlotte Flair Matches (& 5 Worst)</a></span></p><p>Charlotte didn't overshadow Trish's triumphant return but she certainly held her own. It was another highlight for two Superstars with a repertoire of achievements underneath their belts.</p><h2 id=bayley-women-s-elimination-chamber-match-2019><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bayley: Women's Elimination Chamber Match, 2019</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sasha-Banks-Bayley-Elimination-Chamber.jpg><p>Bayley and Sasha Banks became the inaugural WWE Women's Tag Team Champions in February 2019 after winning the titles in the women's Elimination Chamber match. The Boss n Hug Connection defeated Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville, Nia Jax and Tamina, The IIconics, Liv Morgan and Sarah Logan and Naomi and Carmella in an intensely physical bout to emerge victorious with championship gold.</p><p>This match is a great example of Bayley and Sasha's in-ring chemistry. They work well together in tandem, particularly when taking down larger opponents such as Tamina and this match was a promising start for the Women's Tag Team titles.</p><h2 id=sasha-banks-sasha-banks-vs-charlotte-flair-vs-becky-lynch-wrestlemania-32><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Sasha Banks: Sasha Banks vs. Charlotte Flair vs. Becky Lynch, WrestleMania 32</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sasha-Banks-Becky-Lynch-Charlotte-Flair-WrestleMania-32.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the best matches of Sasha Banks' career hails from her earlier days on the main roster. After challenging Charlotte for the Divas Championship, The Boss and The Man took on Flair in a triple-threat match on The Grandest Stage of Them All for the newly introduced WWE Women's Championship.</p><p>Each Superstar had a chance to shine and demonstrate their exceptional abilities. This match felt like a momentous occasion.&nbsp;WWE did away with the butterfly belt and the Divas moniker and this match felt like the true beginning of a revolution.</p><h2 id=becky-lynch-becky-lynch-vs-charlotte-flair-evolution-2019><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Becky Lynch: Becky Lynch vs. Charlotte Flair, Evolution 2019</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Becky-Lynch-Charlotte-Flair-Evolution.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the most entertaining feuds of 2019 - and Becky Lynch's career - is The Man's rivalry with her former partner Charlotte Flair. Lynch defeated Flair and went on to defend it against her at the first all-female pay-per-view Evolution in what was easily the best match on the card.</p><p>Lynch and Flair fought in a Last Woman Standing match that pushed the boundaries and elevated women's wrestling. The Man emerged victorious, struggling to her feet after performing a leg drop from the ladder onto her opponent.</p><h2 id=charlotte-flair-charlotte-vs-sasha-banks-raw-2016><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Charlotte Flair: Charlotte vs. Sasha Banks, Raw 2016</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sasha-Banks-3.jpg><p>Charlotte Flair and Sasha Banks were at the forefront of the Women's Evolution during 2016. After they were drafted to Raw, The Boss defeated The Queen for the Raw Women's Championship and the two spent the next few months winning and losing the title from each other in a series of high-profile matches.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Shocking Female Heel Turns</a></span></p><p>Charlotte's best match with Sasha is their Falls Count Anywhere match which saw The Boss trap Flair in a Bank Statement around a metal railing and making her tap out to win the championship. Ric Flair came to the ring to congratulate&nbsp;Charlotte's enemy on her win, making it a bitter moment for The Queen.</p><h2 id=bayley-sasha-banks-vs-bayley-nxt-brooklyn><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Bayley: Sasha Banks vs. Bayley, NXT: Brooklyn</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bayley-Sasha-Banks-NXT-Brooklyn.jpg><p>Sasha Banks and Bayley lit a flame that sparked a revolution when they faced each other for the NXT Women's Championship at NXT: Brooklyn before their ascension to the main roster. The match had solid storytelling, with Banks a vicious bad guy and Bayley a gutsy babyface, and both women demonstrated their exceptional in-ring skill.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were firmly behind Bayley and there wasn't a dry eye in the arena when the Huggable One finally pinned Banks to win the championship. Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch joined them in the ring for a post-match celebration with the crowd giving thanks to the NXT Four Horsewomen.</p><h2 id=sasha-banks-becky-lynch-vs-sasha-banks-hell-in-a-cell-2019><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sasha Banks: Becky Lynch vs. Sasha Banks, Hell In A Cell 2019</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Becky-Lynch-Sasha-Banks-Hell-in-a-Cell.jpg><p>Bayley isn't the only NXT Horsewoman who turned heel in 2019. Sasha Banks returned after a four-month hiatus and immediately inserted herself into the title picture by unveiling a new look and savagely attacking Raw Women's Champion and former tag-team partner Becky Lynch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Boss and The Man fought in a Hell in a Cell match that was hard-hitting, creative and made spectacular use of the cell. A highlight includes Lynch suspending Banks against the cell wall on a chair before dropkicking her off the apron.</p><h2 id=becky-lynch-becky-lynch-vs-asuka-vs-charlotte-flair-tlc-2018><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Becky Lynch: Becky Lynch vs. Asuka vs. Charlotte Flair, TLC 2018</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Asuka-Becky-Lynch-Charlotte-Flair-TLC.jpg><p><a href=#>Becky Lynch</a> showed exceptional skill, charisma, and tenacity during her meteoric 2018, especially during her TLC match against Charlotte Flair and Asuka. All three women showed no mercy, savagely attacking each other with steel chairs and pulling out all the stops to capture the SmackDown Women's Championship.</p><p>Asuka won this match and her first championship on the main roster after Ronda Rousey interfered. The Baddest Woman on the Planet, seeking revenge after being attacked by Flair and Lynch, pushed over a ladder and paved the way for the Empress of Tomorrow to grab the belt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlotte-flair-charlotte-flair-vs-ronda-rousey-survivor-series-2018><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Charlotte Flair: Charlotte Flair vs. Ronda Rousey, Survivor Series 2018</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Charlotte-Flair-Ronda-Rousey-Survivor-Series.jpg><p>This match was a last-minute replacement for the highly anticipated clash between Becky Lynch and Ronda Rousey after The Man was injured by Nia Jax. Lynch chose Flair to be her replacement and The Queen certainly took the fight to Rousey, though soon learned that the former UFC star wasn't the easy beat she was expecting.</p><p>The ending of the match saw Charlotte snap and turn heel, a role that suits her far better, before viciously attacking Rousey with a steel chair. This&nbsp;eventually led to&nbsp;Charlotte's inclusion in the triple-threat main event match at WrestleMania 35 as there was unfinished business between Rousey and Flair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>5 Women Who Should Eliminate Charlotte Flair In The Royal Rumble (& 5 Who Shouldn't)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenp7K0wMuipaBnnq3BbrLOrqlmoJ%2BnwKbDzqacp2WSmsC1ecyaq5yglah6s63NpJydZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dachau-reprisals.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Dachau Massacre Of Concentration Camp Guards After Liberation">&larr;
