It is 1 minute and thirty-six minutes long.</p><p>The trailer begins with three masked females entering a house at night with a gun in their hands. The first question they ask the house owner is, where is the money?</p><p>The trailer then shows a top view of Los Angeles, California and immediately after that, we hear Diamond talking to E saying that her grandmother is sick.</p><p>After that, we are drawn to the hospital scene, where the three sisters are taking updates on their grandmother, to which Dr. Thomas replies in a low voice.</p><figure></figure><p>She continues by saying that after running a blood test on Pat, they have found signs of cancer, and have no health insurance.</p><p>Next, we see Diamond with E.
