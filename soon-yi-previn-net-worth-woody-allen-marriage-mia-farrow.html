People liked the witty dialogue, Diane Keaten's stylish outfits, and using New York City like a character. But as soon as Woody Allen married his stepdaughter Soon Yi Previn, people were understandably uncomfortable about continuing to support Woody's films. And then <a href=#>Woody Allen's daughter Dylan Farrow</a> accused him of sexual abuse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many <a href=#>stars wish they hadn't worked with Woody Allen</a>, and it's tough to ignore the fact that Woody Allen began a relationship with his stepdaughter and then married her. In Woody Allen's memoir, he shared why they decided to get married. Even though people know that Woody was married to Soon Yi's stepmother Mia Farrow when they became involved, the couple hasn't been interviewed very much in the decades since. Keep reading to find out how marrying Woody Allen has changed Soon Yi Previn's financial situation.</p><h2 id=woody-allen-and-soon-yi-previn-got-married>Woody Allen And Soon Yi Previn Got Married</h2><p>While Woody Allen's original publisher decided not to go ahead with his book 'Apros Of Nothing",<a href=#> Woody Allen's memoir did get published</a>, and he talked about marrying Soon Yi Previn.</p><p>Woody Allen wrote that he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">married Soon Yi Previn to protect her finances</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Page Six, Woody was thinking about the age difference between them (35 years) and he wrote, “I adored Soon-Yi and knew I was much older and could drop dead at a moment’s notice. If I did, I wanted her to be legally protected, to get all I owned automatically with no hitches.”</p><p>Woody also wrote that they didn't need or want to get married but it made the most sense. He said, “As far as marriage was concerned, neither of us had any great need to formalize our relationship. We both felt that no contract is worth the paper it’s printed on if the parties are not happy. We loved each other and there was no need to resort to legislature. We would definitely not wed, and that was that. And then we married. Why? Not for romantic reasons but strictly financial.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Woody Allen And Wife Soon-Yi Previn Are So Private About Their Kids</a></span></p><p>It's also likely that Woody Allen and Soon Yi Previn share a bank account or that they share finances somehow since they are married and Woody wrote about wanting to make sure that she would be okay. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Woody Allen has a $140 million net worth,</a> according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>Hollywood Life reported that the couple lives in the Upper West Side in New York City and that they have two daughters who they adopted.

Farrow.</p><p>The Washington Post reported that Alissa Wilkinson, the film critic for Vox, said that people can watch Woody Allen's movies and see some proof of "grooming." The critic focused on the 1979 film Manhatten and wrote, “You get the feeling watching Woody Allen’s films that he’s trying to make us acclimated to the idea of these kinds of relationships, this sort of power dynamic — in a sense, grooming us. It’s something that he does repeatedly, over and over, in films. Throughout the years, the same archetypes show up. The same kinds of big age gaps in relationships show up. When you see it over and over, it kind of attunes you to thinking, this is normal.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Alec Baldwin And Woody Allen's Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=woody-allen-and-soon-yi-previn-39-s-relationship>Woody Allen And Soon Yi Previn's Relationship</h2><p>In an interview with New York Magazine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Soon Yi Previn talked about her childhood</a>, and she said that her adoptive mother Mia Farrow began dating Woody Allen when Soon Yi was ten years old.

And the feeling was mutual; we weren’t interested in meeting him. I hated him because he was with my mother, and I didn’t understand why anyone could be with such a nasty, mean person.
