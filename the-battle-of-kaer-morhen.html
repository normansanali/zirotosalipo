Enter Kaer Morhen keep and begin the council.</h3><p>Go to the main hall of the castle, where everyone involved in the battle will gather to establish a plan of action. During the meeting you will have to make two choices regarding your limited resources:</p><ul><li>The first decision will be whether Vesemir should use the laboratory to complete the production of the potions (you'll get a thunderbolt potion, a superior swallow potion, and Lesser Perun runestone, +50 XP), or whether Eskel should use it to create traps (the traps will damage the Wild Hunt warriors during the battle).</li><li>The second decision will be whether you should clear the armory (all witchers will do more damage, and you'll receive a relic silver sword - <strong>Rose of Shaerrawed</strong>) or patch a hole in the wall (less enemies).</li></ul><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/enter-kaer-morhen-keep-and-begin-the-council.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Enter Kaer Morhen keep and begin the council." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>The friends conferred and established a defense strategy. There was no time to lose. As soon as they finished, the weather changed and snow began to fall. The Wild Hunt appeared above Kaer Morhen and its spectral warriors galloped out of the sky towards the fortress.</p><h3 class=he-c>2. Exit the keep and join Lambert when you're ready to face the Wild Hunt.</h3><p>When you go outside, the weather will change after a while, announcing the arrival of the Wild Hunt. You, Lambert and Letho (if available) will get on your horses and go into the forest to close the portals through which the Wild Hunt warriors arrive.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/exit-the-keep-and-join-lambert-when-youre-ready-to-face-the-wild-hunt.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Exit the keep and join Lambert when you're ready to face the Wild Hunt." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>3. Use dimeritium bombs or the Yrden Sign to close all the Hunt's portals in the woods around Kaer Morhen. 0/3 / Kill the Wild Hunt warriors near the (center / left / right) portal in the forest.</h3><p>You must close three portals located in the forest south of the castle. You can use dimeritium bombs or the Yrden sign to close them. Each of the portals will be defended by the Wild Hunt warriors (24) and the hounds of the Wild Hunt (22).</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/use-dimeritium-bombs-or-the-yrden-sign-to-close-the-hunts-portals-and-stop-their-attack-on-kaer-morhen.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Use dimeritium bombs or the Yrden Sign to close all the Hunt's portals in the woods around Kaer Morhen. 0/3 / Kill the Wild Hunt warriors near the (center / left / right) portal in the forest." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>After destroying the last of the portals, Imlerith will appear nearby. Geral will use the crossbow to send a signal for Triss to attack, but nothing will happen, which means that Triss is in trouble. The action will move to the castle and you will take control of Ciri for a while.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/use-dimeritium-bombs-or-the-yrden-sign-to-close-the-hunts-portals-and-stop-their-attack-on-kaer-morhen-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Use dimeritium bombs or the Yrden Sign to close all the Hunt's portals in the woods around Kaer Morhen. 0/3 / Kill the Wild Hunt warriors near the (center / left / right) portal in the forest." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>4.

If Zoltan is available, he will kill the Wild Hunt warrior who walks towards you. The you should run across the battlements to Triss and kill all enemies that are around. You can use your new skills: <strong>Magic Amulet</strong> (It calls down a fireball to pulverize a given area. Once you use it, you should move aside, or a magic projectile will hit you!), and <strong>Charge</strong> (Very strong and fast attack that can knocks down foes).</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/run-to-trisss-aid-on-the-battlements.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Run to Triss's aid on the battlements. / Defeat the warriors threatening Triss." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>5. Return to Kaer Morhen.</h3><p>You'll be playing as Geralt again. You, Lambert and Letho will jump on the horses and head back to the castle. Gallop as fast as you can and avoid fireballs falling from the sky. When you reach the courtyard, Vesemir will tell you to close the main gate.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/return-to-kaer-morhen.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Return to Kaer Morhen." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>The defenders of Kaer Morhen did what they could to hold back their attackers, but the enemy's strength was overwhelming. The Wild Hunt had made it to the very walls of Kaer Morhen.</p><h3 class=he-c>6. Close the main gate.</h3><p>Climb a nearby ladder to the battlements or run to the opposite end of the courtyard, and get to the walls there.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/close-the-main-gate-1.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Close the main gate." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>Then use the lever that lowers the gate.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/close-the-main-gate-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Close the main gate." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>7. (Optional) Help Lambert defeat the Hunt's warriors.</h3><p>This objective will only be available if you have failed to convince Keira to come to Kaer Morhen. Lambert will get into serious trouble and his life will be in danger. You will have to help him kill the Wild Hunt warriors before they kill him.</p><p>If Keira is in the castle, you'll only see the cutscene of how she uses magic and saves Lambert from oppression.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/help-lambert-defeat-the-hunts-warriors-keira.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="(Optional) Help Lambert defeat the Hunt's warriors." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>8. Retreat to the middle courtyard. / Defeat your opponents and retreat behind the main gate.</h3><p>Yennefer's spell will begin to wane, so you'll have to retreat to the middle courtyard. When you do that, Vesemir will destroy and block the gate between the lower and middle courtyards.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/retreat-to-the-middle-courtyard.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Retreat to the middle courtyard. / Defeat your opponents and retreat behind the main gate." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>You have to fight the Wild Hunt warriors who are in the middle courtyard until you hear Vesemir shouting that you should check the gate to the main courtyard, then run to that gate. Unfortunately the gate will be closed, which means that Eskel who was supposed to open it is in trouble. Vesemir will decide that Eskel will certainly manage on its own and that you should help Triss in the meantime.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/defeat-your-opponents-and-retreat-behind-the-main-gate.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Retreat to the middle courtyard. / Defeat your opponents and retreat behind the main gate." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>9. Get to Triss. / Help Triss fight the Hunt's warriors.</h3><p>Go help Triss.

After a while, when Caranthir starts using magic tricks, and thus tip the scales of victory in his favor, Ciri will join the fight and save Eskel. However, she won't defeat Caranthir because after a while, at the sound of the Wild Hunt horn, Caranthir will use the teleport and retreat, and only his warriors will remain on the battlefield.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/help-triss-fight-the-hunts-warriors-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Get to Triss. / Help Triss fight the Hunt's warriors." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>10. Defeat Caranthir's warriors. / Open the gate to Kaer Morhen's inner courtyard.</h3><p>You'll be playing Ciri again for a while. Together with Eskel, kill the Caranthir's warriors and then proceed towards the main gate. Eliminate any further opponents that stand in your way. When you reach the gate, use the large turning wheel to open it.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/open-the-gate-to-kaer-morhens-inner-courtyard.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Defeat Caranthir's warriors. / Open the gate to Kaer Morhen's inner courtyard." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>When the gate opens, Geralt and the others will retreat to the upper courtyard. You'll be controlling the witcher again and Vesemir will give you two dimeritium bombs to close the portals that opened.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/open-the-gate-to-kaer-morhens-inner-courtyard-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Defeat Caranthir's warriors. / Open the gate to Kaer Morhen's inner courtyard." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>Warrior after warrior fell to our heroes' blows, but others immediately took their place. The defenders fell back beyond the inner gates of the fortress - and so began the last phase of the battle.</p><h3 class=he-c>11. Use dimeritium bombs or the Yrden Sign to close the Hunt's portals and stop their attack on Kaer Morhen. 0/2</h3><p>You must close one portal on the right side of the castle and one on the left side. You can use dimeritium bombs or Yrden sign. When you do that, you'll hear Triss calling for help.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/use-dimeritium-bombs-or-the-yrden-sign-to-close-the-hunts-portals-and-stop-their-attack-on-kaer-morhen-3.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Use dimeritium bombs or the Yrden Sign to close the Hunt's portals and stop their attack on Kaer Morhen. 0/2" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>11.1. (Optional) Equip yourself with dimeritium bombs from Vesemir's supplies.</h3><p>If you run out of bombs, you can replenish your inventory by taking more bombs from one of the several chests that are around. You can take two bombs at a time, but the supplies are unlimited.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/equip-yourself-with-dimeritium-bombs-from-vesemirs-supplies-1.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="(Optional) Equip yourself with dimeritium bombs from Vesemir's supplies." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>12.

Fortunately, Avallac'h will appear on the balcony of the castle and use his own power to calm Ciri down.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/help-triss-fight-the-wild-hunt-by-the-gate-to-the-inner-courtyard-3.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Help Triss fight the Wild Hunt by the gate to the inner courtyard." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>It was a dark hour for the defenders of Kaer Morhen. The generals of the Hunt had entered the fray personally. Vesemir had died by Imlerith's hand, and it seemed all of the witcher's friends would soon share his fate. The defenders' lives were hanging by a thread, when suddenly Ciri's magic talent revealed its full force. In an uncontrolled outburst of rage she pummeled both allies and enemies alike with a blast of pure Power. The Hunt's forces were nearly wiped out, leaving them no choice but to retreat. Only our valiant defenders, exhausted, wounded, but still alive, remained on the field of battle.</p><p>When the evening comes, Vesemir's funeral will take place, during which Ciri will say she's tired of running away and Avallac'h will ask you to talk, and then the quest will be over.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/20/screenshots/2020/05/640/help-triss-fight-the-wild-hunt-by-the-gate-to-the-inner-courtyard-5.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Help Triss fight the Wild Hunt by the gate to the inner courtyard." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>If only Vesemir died in the battle:</p><p>The Battle of Kaer Morhen was over.
