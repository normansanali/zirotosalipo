Garrison was married to Debbie Garrison. They married in 2005. Beyond this scanty information about his marital life, we have no further information on Debbie and what she does for a living or her background.</p><h2><strong>Who was Walt Garrison?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Walt Garrison was an American professional football player who was a fullback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys.</p><h2><strong>Walt Garrison biography&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Garrison, a native of Denton, Texas, attended Lewisville High School where he excelled as a linebacker in football, as well as in basketball and baseball. He was awarded a football scholarship from Oklahoma State University, where he intended to continue playing as a linebacker. During his freshman year in 1962, he played in two games as a linebacker for the freshmen team against Arkansas and Oklahoma.</p><p>In 1963, Phil Cutchin took over as head coach and moved Garrison to the running back position, despite his lack of experience in the position during high school. Despite being a backup player, Garrison finished his sophomore season with 387 rushing yards, just twelve yards behind the team’s leading rusher, George Thomas, and ranked tenth in the Big Eight Conference.</p><p>As a junior in 1964, Garrison led the Big Eight Conference in rushing with 730 yards, surpassing Jim Grisham and Gale Sayers. He also recorded five rushing touchdowns and 83 receiving yards. In his senior year, Garrison recorded 924 rushing yards, 107 receiving yards, and five touchdowns.</p><p>He ranked second in rushing yards in the Big Eight Conference, just 13 yards behind Missouri’s Charlie Brown. Garrison’s standout performances included rushing for 121 yards on 19 carries against the undefeated University of Nebraska, and 173 yards against Kansas. He also played a pivotal role in helping the Cowboys secure their first win over Oklahoma in 20 years.</p><p>Garrison’s post-season highlights included appearances in the East-West Shrine Game in San Francisco, the Senior Bowl (where he was voted the Outstanding Back of the North team), the Coaches All-America Game in Atlanta, and the College All-Star Game against the Green Bay Packers in August 1966.</p><h2><strong>What to happened Walt Garrison?&nbsp;</strong></h2><figure id=attachment_378261 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-378261 class="wp-caption alignnone"><strong>Walt Garrison</strong></figure><p>The NFL franchise announced that Garrison passed away overnight in a story that went up on their website on Thursday. The reason for death was not stated. After playing for nine years in Dallas after being selected in the fifth round of the draft out of Oklahoma State University, Garrison retired in 1974 with the ranking of No. 3 rusher and No. 4 receiver in franchise history. With 4.32 yards per run and 3,491 rushing yards, he remains ninth on Dallas’ all-time ranking.</p><p>A close friend, Butch Baker confirmed his death in an emotional tribute shared on Facebook which reads;</p><p>“In 1981 when I asked Roger Staubach his thoughts on Walt Garrison, he said…”The toughest man I’ve ever seen, on and off the field. He played in a game with a broken collarbone and a mile of athletic tape.” Walt Garrison, my favorite Dallas Cowboy died yesterday at the age of 79. A 5th-round draft choice for the Cowboys in 1966, Walt negotiated his signing bonus for a Pontiac Bonneville Convertible and a 2-horse Trailer. He played college for (where else) the Oklahoma State Cowboys. Walt Garrison was not only a professional NFL football player but a professional Rodeo steer wrestler as well. He was inducted into the Pro Rodeo Hall Of Fame in 2018. I own one Dallas Cowboy jersey…and it’s #32. Rest easy “Little Puddin’” and thanks for giving it your all as an OSU Cowboy, Dallas Cowboy, and most of all…an American Cowboy.”</p><h2><strong>Who is Walt Garrison wife?</strong></h2><p>In 2005, they tied the knot. We don’t know anything more about Debbie’s history or occupation beyond this little information concerning his marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGiumqtdqbWmec%2Brpp%2Bdo6i2sLrApWSfp5%2Bpr6K4y2anpZmpmr9uucCrqaKdlGQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./where-does-street-fighter-6-come-in-the-series-chronology.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where does Street Fighter 6 come in the series chronology?">&larr;
