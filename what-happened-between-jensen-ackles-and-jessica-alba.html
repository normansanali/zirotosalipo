For all intents and purposes, though, <a href=#>Alba walked away from acting</a> as a career a while ago.</p><p>She explained the reasoning behind this in an interview last year, where she pointed to the tough balancing act of <a href=#>being a successful businesswoman</a>, a mother to her three children, and a professional actor all at the same time.</p><p>The decision to quit acting was not a permanent one, however, and she is due to return to the big screen in an upcoming action thriller movie going by the title Trigger Warning.</p><p>Alba will be hoping the second phase of her career can surpass the heights of her first. One of her biggest roles before was in the sci-fi drama series Dark Angel, which aired on Fox between 2000 and 2002.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Are Ecstatic Over Zac Efron’s First TikTok Ever With Jessica Alba</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The role wasn’t all smooth sailing, though, as she reportedly <a href=#>had a rough time working with co-star Jensen Ackles</a> on the set of the show.</p><h2 id=jessica-alba-starred-as-max-guevara-in-lsquo-dark-angel-rsquo>Jessica Alba Starred As Max Guevara In ‘Dark Angel’</h2><p>Dark Angel was created by legendary director James Cameron, who had started to develop various concepts for television on the back of his success with Titanic in 1997. Fox commissioned the project, and invested $10 million into a two-hour pilot.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A plot summary for the show on IMDb</a> reads: ‘In a future of political, economic and moral collapse, a genetically enhanced superhuman prototype named Max escapes from military confines and dwells amidst the decadent underground street life of Seattle to avoid government agents who want to bring her back into the fold.’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More than one thousand actresses auditioned for the lead role of Max Guevara.

For 115 episodes between 1997 and 2000, he portrayed the character Eric Brady.</p><p>After he left Days of Our Lives, Ackles started pursuing new opportunities on television. He featured in a CBS biographical film called Blonde, which starred Australian actress Poppy Montgomery as Marylin Monroe.</p><p>He also <a href=#>auditioned for the lead role Clark Kent</a> / Superman in The WB’s Smallville, a part that he lost out to Tom Welling. Ackles would later on appear on the show in a different role a few years later.</p><p>It wasn’t too long after his time on Days of Our Lives that the Texas-born star was cast in Dark Angel. He first appeared in the 18th episode of Season 1 (Pollo Loco), as the character known as Ben / X5-493.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What Jensen Ackles Had To Say About His Time On 'Days Of Our Lives'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ackles’ spell on Dark Angel spanned the course of 22 episodes, until it was canceled after only two seasons.</p><h2 id=why-did-jensen-ackles-and-jessica-alba-not-get-along-on-the-set-of-lsquo-dark-angel-rsquo>Why Did Jensen Ackles And Jessica Alba Not Get Along On The Set Of ‘Dark Angel’?</h2><p>Jensen Ackles revisited the challenges that he faced on the set of Dark Angel earlier this year, when he featured in an episode of Michael Rosenbaum’s podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside You with Michael Rosenbaum</a>.</p><p>In the interview, he revealed that as soon as he arrived to work on the show, Jessica Alba was immediately on his case. “I was the new kid on the block, and I was picked on by the lead. She had it out for me,” the actor said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He did offer a disclaimer that, nonetheless, there was no bad blood between them. “It wasn’t that she didn’t like me,” Ackles continued. “She just was like, ‘Oh, here’s the pretty boy that network brought in for some more window dressing because that’s what we all need.’”</p><p>In the end, Ackles figured that the only way to respond was to “fight fire with fire” which helped them to develop a sense of strong respect for each other. “It was that kind of a relationship,” he added. “If she walked in we’d be all hugs. But she didn’t make it easy on me on set.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Jessica Alba's 10 Biggest Movies & TV Roles</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmopWjwKa6jJqapKSVqHqiusNmoZ6ro56wonnApZmaZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./where-was-peter-pan-wendy-filmed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where was Peter Pan &amp;amp; Wendy filmed?">&larr;
