He got them out of bed. He got them banging on their desk as if it were a drum set. And maybe he even got them to do a little good in this world. Taylor always inspired positivity, loyalty, and kindness while still being the totally bad*** drummer of The Foo Fighters. So, when he <a href=#>tragically lost his life in March 2022</a>, his millions of fans felt a collective lump in their throat and perhaps something missing from their heart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But it's not just fans mourning his loss. Numerous celebrities have also <a href=#>shared heartbreaking messages of grief</a> and love following his passing. Among them is radio legend <a href=#><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a> who had a unique relationship with both Taylor and the band that made him a superstar...</p><h2 id=how-howard-stern-met-taylor-hawkins>How Howard Stern Met Taylor Hawkins</h2><p>Howard Stern's relationship with Taylor Hawkins goes back to 1998 when The Foo Fighters were interviewed on his acclaimed, groundbreaking, and often controversial radio show. While the interview was strong, the segment was important for a different reason. According to Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl, it was in this moment that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard made one of their songs a hit</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is How Dave Grohl Created His Foo Fighter's Hit Song 'Everlong'</a></span></p><p>"Everlong" is one of The Foo Fighters most recognizable songs. But it wasn't this way until Howard asked them to do a live acoustic version on his insaenly popular show. Immediately, the song found new life, became enormously successful, and made the original version a straight-up hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, this was just the first of The Foo Fighters many appearances on The Stern Show. In fact, they are one of the most frequent musical guests. Therefore, Howard has gotten to know each of the members of the band pretty well, including Taylor Hawkins.</p><h2 id=what-howard-stern-said-about-taylor-hawkins>What Howard Stern Said About Taylor Hawkins</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard addressed Taylor's passing on his show </a>in a lengthy segment that praised the drummer for both his musical skills and his kindness. He stated that Taylor was "a real friend of the show" but also someone that he "loved and admired".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I can't tell you how sad I was when I woke up [and found out that he passed] after this guy has been on the show so many times," Howard said to his audience and co-host Robin Quivers. "He looked like a rock star. He had the talent. He had everything. He was an excellent drummer."</p><p>Howard also recalled the first time the band came into the studio and how Robin was fawning over him. Her little crush on Taylor became a running gag whenever he came into the studio.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Robin Quivers Openly Flirted With These Celebrities On The Howard Stern Show</a></span></p><p>"I loved him," Robin added. "I thought he was so cool and so sweet."</p><p>Howard also stated that he was blown away by Taylor's love and support of Dave Grohl, who he could have easily been competitive with. Their brotherhood inspired him personally, and it was something that you didn't have to dig deep to find. Taylor and Dave's connection was obvious, openly loving, and downright infectious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Their friendship was one of the great partnerships in music," Howard said during his March 28 show, before explaining that Taylor was initially nervous about drumming in the former Nirvana drummer's new band. But Dave believed in Taylor and knew he would be the best possible person to take up the sticks for The Foo Fighters.</p><p>"Even in 1999, Dave knew that their partnership would last," Howard explained. "He offered to pay me if he ever fired Taylor. That's how much he believed in him."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Dave Grohl's Tragic Hearing Loss</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The love went two ways, of course. Howard even played audio from Taylor's final concert where he praised Dave for giving him the career he never thought he'd have.</p><p>Despite Dave giving Taylor his big shot, the drummer was always utterly dedicated to his craft. This was something that Howard deeply respected and spoke about with Taylor on numerous occasions. Fans of The Howard Stern Show are aware that the self-proclaimed King Of All Media is a believer in dedicated practice. And this is precisely what Taylor did to rise to the top in his industry. He was utterly obsessed with drumming. He loved every second of it. And he committed himself to being the best he could.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the notoriously reclusive Howard Stern never really spent time with Taylor Hawkins in his personal life, it's clear that he loved him. The fact that he got to see Taylor once or twice a year on his show established a connection and shorthand between them. It's also what made it so hard for Howard when he found out about Taylor's sudden passing.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Real Reason Howard Stern Is A Great Celebrity Interviewer, According To Him</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWww8Crm2arpJq%2Fr3nSmqCdZZGXvLbAjK2YsqSfp3qprdakoKerXZmyosDHaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tony-jefferson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tony Jefferson">&larr;
