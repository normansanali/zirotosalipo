He concluded the writing while wondering how to choose himself. The talented writer also hoped he was doing woke right because something didn’t feel right to him.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=christopher-rivas-father-is-dominican-and-his-mother-is-colombian></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Christopher Rivas Father Is Dominican And His Mother Is Colombian</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The actor was </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>born and raised</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;in New York City by his parents.
