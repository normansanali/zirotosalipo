McDonald accused Katy of making 'snarky' comments about his daughter when she was on the show. McDonald shared a lengthy statement in a now-deleted Instagram post. He noted in his statement that Ani idolized Katy for years and accused the pop star of devastating his daughter while critiquing her performance on the show. Mac started his post, "Several years ago, an impressionable teenager was in Chaplin Studios to record an Apple recording for her tenure on the Voice as the youngest minor finalist that year." He continued, "She still had stars in her eyes as she became exhilarated by living a dream with her proximity to people she had only fantasized about. Once done she rushed out of her long recording session, screaming 'Daddy did you see her?' I said who she said that was Katy Perry." Mac went on, "As fate would have it that impressionable teenager met her as a young adult on the American Idol stage."</p><p>McDonald further said, "The young girl known as Wé McDonald now known as Wé Ani stood in front of someone who she had once idolized devastated her with an undeserved snarky response as a redirect to critiquing her show performance." McDonald added that "It was a dagger in the heart given by a respected star with concern regarding any of Katy's subsequence responses regarding her American Idol performances." McDonald concluded his post saying, "The star designation descended to a regular bully that attacked Wé Ani as a child. No acknowledgment or apology, just a collar pop and a shoulder brush. Remember this, lesson learned. See you at the Grammys."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/7d01c642-2e06-47f0-8c62-25aa85c14da8.jpg><h2 class=split>'Grow a thicker skin'</h2><p>'American Idol' Season 21 viewers have chimed in to back Katy in a Reddit thread. A social media user wrote, "LOOOOL and people are complaining the judges don’t seem to critique their performance at all. Imagine giving very vanilla generic compliments to every performance and still get someone this angry lol." Another user commented, "This exactly!!! What do they want Katy to do?? Praise her uncontrollably without any side critique? I swear the contestant these days are so pampered. You wanna be a star you have to deal with this stuff. Even if We won the whole show she’s not even entitle to be successful. The work AFTER the show is what matters the most." Another viewer noted, "Why don't judges critique anyone anymore? Well there u go it’s 2023 and everyone takes things personal." Another follower penned, "Do you think Katy Perry’s DADDY hopped on Instagram every time she was turned down or received harsh criticism? Grow a thicker skin, you’re tarnishing your daughter’s name in doing this. Making you BOTH look foolish." Another person added, "Wé probably already knows this, but her father should be reminded; if you can't take the most generic, softball critique that Idol is giving out these days, you aren't ready for the music industry."</p><p>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
