She's worked with major brands like Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, Stella McCartney, and Mugler. She also walked the runway for <strong><a href=#>Rihanna</a></strong>'s <a href=#>Savage x Fenty fashion show</a> in 2021.Though <a href=#>she's frequently accused of nepotism</a>, the 25-year-old has actually <a href=#>amassed a $5 million fortune all by herself</a>.We're sure her parents are proud of her. But how come we never hear about her dad? Here's everything you should know about him and his relationship with Madonna and their daughter.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Madonna Turned Down The Role Of This Iconic DC Comics Character</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-lourdes-leon-s-father>Who Is Lourdes Leon's Father?</h2><p>The model's father is Carlos Leon, a personal trainer and actor. He had credited parts in The Big Lebowski, The Replacement Killers, The Woodsman, and Tricks of Love.</p><p>The Cuban native met Madonna back in 1994. The two reportedly dated for three years until 1997. There were also rumors that they got engaged at one point. But to this day, many believe that Leon only "helped" <a href=#>the Queen of Pop</a> "to conceive," after Dennis Rodman "failed" to do so.</p><p>In 2019, <a href=#>the former NBA player</a> revealed that Madonna was willing to give him $20 million dollars for a baby. He even said that one time, the singer called him while he was "rolling the dice in Vegas," because she was ovulating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He then put a hold on the table and got on a plane she had sent for him. After what we'd assume was a quickie in the Vogue hitmaker's New York home, Rodman flew right back to Las Vegas. "I tried," he told The Breakfast Club of his attempt to impregnate Madonna.</p><p>"She asked me that if I got her pregnant, she'd pay me $20 million. That's if the child was born." Rodman said of Madonna's offer, adding that he thinks she had the same financial arrangement with Lourdes' father. The former basketball player only dated the pop star for two months in the same year she met Leon.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Madonna Music Video That Was Banned From MTV</a></span></p><h2 id=is-madonna-s-daughter-lourdes-leon-close-to-her-dad>Is Madonna's Daughter Lourdes Leon Close To Her Dad?</h2><p>Leon is reportedly "in daily communication with his daughter," per Distractify. Speaking to Hello! in 2011, the personal trainer revealed that his daughter with Madonna is "everything" to him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I have no regrets. I wouldn't change anything," he said of his three-year relationship with the Evita star. "I got the best thing out of that relationship, and that is my daughter. My daughter is everything to me." He also confessed to being a "lenient dad" to his then-14-year-old child.</p><p>"I'm very empathetic and I'm good at listening to my daughter," Leon explained. "I'm probably a bad dad when it comes to disciplining her."</p><p>Still, he strictly imposed curfews to ensure her safety. "I try to work with her on it," said the father of two. "We settle on a time, say around 10 pm, and she's like, 'How about 10.30?'. And it eventually becomes 10.15." He added that he'd always see her as his "little girl," which is why he said he was "already overprotective, so when the time comes, I will be ready to have a talk with the guy she brings through the door. He better be ready, because I'll give him the rundown!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, Leon also hinted at his daughter's future in fashion, revealing that she was a tough style critic. "Sometimes she will give me a hard time about my clothes," said the patriarch. "I wore a pair of jeans once, and they weren't as skinny as I usually wear them, and she was like, 'Oh my God, Dad, those pants are so ugly. Please change your pants. They were too bootcut, so I changed [chuckles]."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Living Next To Madonna Was A Nightmare For Her Neighbours</a></span></p><h2 id=where-is-madonna-s-ex-carlos-leon-now>Where Is Madonna's Ex, Carlos Leon Now?</h2><p>Leon has been married to Zac Posen designer, Betina Holte since 2013. They also have a seven-year-old son named Meeka. Madonna's ex has kept a low profile after their split in 1997. Still, they've managed to maintain a good co-parenting relationship.</p><p>"I have a great relationship with all my ex-girlfriends, but especially Madonna," Leon told The Billy Bush Show in 2008. "There was a friendship and there still is a friendship. If she needs to talk to me I'm there and if I need to talk to her she's there. That's the way it goes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Why Has Madonna Been Banned From Instagram Live?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuwMeeZJ%2BZpJ2ys3nOn2SmmZSku6%2Bt0mabmq2XncGmvoylpq6qlJrAbrjEqKVo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./motorola-droid-x2-review-a-droid-x-with-tegra-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="WiFi Hotspot, Speakerphone, Call Quality, and GPS - Motorola Droid X2 Review">&larr;
